/* Describe the median, or explain why there isn't one

calculateMedian is given to you at the top of describe-median.js. It throws
when it can't calculate a median. Don't change it.

Implement describeMedian, which calls calculateMedian and returns a sentence
instead of crashing.

E.g. describeMedian([1, 2, 3]), target output: "The median is 2"
E.g. describeMedian([]), target output: "Could not calculate a median: calculateMedian requires a non-empty array"

You'll need a try/catch block for this. The catch block must use the error's
message, so the caller can see what went wrong.

// Acceptance criteria:

// Given an array of numbers
// When passed to describeMedian
// Then it should return "The median is " followed by the median
// Delete this test.todo and replace it with a test.
test.todo('given [1, 2, 3], returns "The median is 2"');

// Given an empty array
// When passed to describeMedian
// Then it should return "Could not calculate a median: calculateMedian requires a non-empty array"

// Given something that isn't an array of numbers, e.g. "banana"
// When passed to describeMedian
// Then it should return "Could not calculate a median: calculateMedian requires an array of numbers"
